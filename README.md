# DeDUCT-De-dupulication-in-Cloud-Environment
DEDUCTâ€™s lightweight preprocessing and client-side deduplication make it suitable for resource- constrained devices like IoT devices. It has also been designed to resist side-channel attacks. Experimental evaluations on the Touchdown dataset, consisting of human-written navigation instructions for routes, demonstrate the effectiveness of DEDUCT.
